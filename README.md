# Algorithm Implementations
A notebook of sort, as practice of standard algorithms.

This current notebook contains the following algorithms -
* **Binary Exponentiation**
Find x^y in O(log(y)), by using binary number representation of y.

* **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) | Union Find**
Data structure to help detect connectivity or so. Use also in graph theory.

* **Kadane's Algorithm**
Helps calculate maximum sum of a subarray in linear time.

* **N Queen Problem**
Sample backtracking application to place N queens in an NxN board.

* **Sieve of Eratosthenes**
Primality checking algorithm to generate primality state of numbers in O(X logX loglogX) where X is the max number whose state is to be known.

* **Towers of Hanoi**
Implementation of well known Towers of Hanoi problem. Recursive. (Problem statement: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)

* **Iterative segment tree**
Iterative implementation of segment tree which is used to solve range queries in logarithmic time instead of linear, using pre-processing of linearithmic time.

* **Recursive segment tree**
Recursive implementation of segment tree.

* **Linear Regression**
Script that obtains data from quandl and applies linear regression to it and predicts stock prices of tesla stock value.
